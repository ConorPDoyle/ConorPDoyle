- 👋 Hi, I’m @ConorPDoyle
- 👀 I’m a high school librarian who is interested in learning more about technology and how it intersects with information literacy.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript, HTML, and CSS, but would eventually like to learn React, SQL, and more! Python? It's all so fun,
I don't think I'll ever stop finding new things to learn.
